<h1>What does Loren Ipsum means?</h1>	
<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the <span style="color:blue">1500s</span>, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only  <span style="color:blue">five centuries</span>, but also the leap into <span style="color:blue">electronic typesetting</span>, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <span style="color:blue"> 1960s</span> with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <span style="color:blue">Aldus PageMaker</span> including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
